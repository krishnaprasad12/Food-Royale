# Food-Royale
Food Royale is an online e-commerce application designed to facilitate food delivery for restaurant vendors. The project is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (JS), and PHP technologies. Here's a breakdown of how these technologies are utilized in the development of this application:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): HTML is used for structuring the web pages of the Food Royale application. It defines the basic elements and layout of the web pages, such as headers, footers, navigation menus, content sections, and forms.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): CSS is employed to enhance the visual appearance and styling of the application. It allows the developers to define the colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and other presentational aspects of the web pages. CSS ensures a consistent and appealing design throughout the application.

JavaScript (JS): JavaScript is a powerful scripting language that enables dynamic and interactive features on web pages. In the Food Royale application, JS is used to implement functionalities such as form validation, handling user interactions, managing shopping cart functionality, and performing AJAX requests for real-time updates without page reloads.

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor): PHP is a server-side scripting language primarily used for web development. It allows for server-side processing, database interactions, and generating dynamic content. In Food Royale, PHP is responsible for handling the backend logic, processing user requests, retrieving and storing data in the database, managing user sessions, and generating dynamic web page content.

The combination of HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP provides a robust foundation for developing an online e-commerce application like Food Royale. These technologies work together to create an engaging user interface, facilitate seamless interactions, and handle the processing and storage of data required for food ordering and delivery.
